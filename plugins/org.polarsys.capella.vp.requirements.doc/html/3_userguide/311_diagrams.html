<h1>Requirements in Diagrams</h1>

<img src="../../images/requirements_diagram_example.png" alt="Requirements Diagram Example" title="Requirements Diagram Example"/>

<p>Requirements and their relations (from/to Capella elements and internal relations between Requirements) can be displayed in your diagrams. For this, the Requirements layer must be activated (activated by default for new diagrams):</p>
<img src="../../images/requirements_layer.png" alt="Requirements Layer" title="Requirements Layer"/>

<p>Once activated, a new segment "Requirements" appears in the palette tools:</p>
<img src="../../images/requirements_segment.png" alt="Requirements Segment" title="Requirements Segment"/>

<p>In this "Requirements" segment, 3 tools are available to show/hide Requirements and their relations.</p>

<h4>All Linked Requirements:</h4>
<p>On a Capella element, show all of its linked Requirements, incoming and outgoing.<br/>
On a Requirement, show all of its internal Requirements, incoming and outgoing.<br/>
On the back of the diagram, show all linked Requirements of the diagram and also all linked Requirements of all graphical elements of the diagram, incoming and outgoing.</p>

<h4>Incoming Requirements:</h4>
<p>Display a wizard to select incoming Requirements to show or hide, from a Capella Element or another Requirement.</p>

<h4>Outgoing Requirements:</h4>
<p>Display a wizard to select outgoing Requirements to show or hide, to a Capella Element or another Requirement.</p>
